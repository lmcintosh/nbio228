    <td><p align="justify">This class is student taught by <a href="http://www.lanemcintosh.com">Lane McIntosh</a> and <a href="http://giocomolab.weebly.com/people.html">Kiah Hardcastle</a>. While this course was started many years ago by Greg Corrado and Marlene Cohen, two students in the Neuroscience PhD program, this is only the second time in 8 years it has been taught. Lane and Kiah decided to create the material from scratch based on feedback from neuroscientists who wanted a better intuition for many of the mathematical tools that have become ubiquitous in neuroscience. </p>
      <p align="justify">The goal of the class is to provide students with an intuitive grasp for some of the mathematical techniques commonly employed in neuroscience through a  fun and relaxed  environnoment.</p>
      <p align="justify">As we learn more about  the brain, the field of neuroscience is becoming increasingly  mathematically oriented. Systems neurocience, fMRI, and microarrays are a few of  the fields in neuroscience that are based on sophisticated mathematical  analysis.&nbsp; We believe that even neuroscients who aren't planning on working on mathematical questions or using mathematically oriented techniques will benefit from being conversant with mathematical terms. This will allow for more collaboration and perhaps a  broader understanding of the field.</p>
    <p align="justify">By the end of the quarter, words  like &quot;PCA&quot;, &quot;fourier transform&quot;, &quot;linear transformation&quot;, and &quot;convolution&quot;  should feel familiar.&nbsp; And most importantly, the weekly class should be  painless, and hopefully even enjoyable, for people who don't normally like math classes. Because the best way to learn math is by <i>doing</i> rather than <em>watching</em>, there is a problem set or two associated with the class, but we recognize Stanford students have a lot of stuff on their plates, and so we work hard to minimize the amount of work you have to do, while maximizing the amount you can gain from the class.</p>
