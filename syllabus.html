    <td><h3>General organization</h3>

      <p>This course will consist of 3 main components: in-class lectures, problem sets, and a class project. There will be 8 in-class lectures, including 2 guest lectures (see schedule below). There will be a problem set associated with every lecture. These problem sets will not be overly difficult or time-consuming but instead will (hopefully!) help you digest the material in a fun, painless, and efficient way. (The same goes for the lectures.) In general, there will be a minimal emphasis on coding, but for some topics we may give a general background on the numerical implementation or methods for finding numerical solutions. In these cases, we might also provide partially-completed code for you to work with (eg for a problem set). For the class projects, we envision that students will either: 1) pick a paper to work through and present (we will provide some potential paper options) or 2) use the methods discussed in class to analyze a dataset. This dataset can be provided by the student, or the course instructors - just let us know what you want to practice your math tools on! The main goal for the class projects is simply to give everyone a chance to practice their new favorite analytical tool in a fun and useful way - beyond that, we are quite flexible. Grades will be based on some combination of the problem sets and class project.</p>
      <p>We hope to make this course both super fun and super useful - especially for those who want to up their data analysis/modeling game (or apply more quantitative techniques to their science) but havenâ€™t taken many math courses beyond calculus. Feel free to email the instructors: Lane McIntosh (lanemc at stanford) and Kiah Hardcastle (khardcas at stanford) if you have any questions!</p>
